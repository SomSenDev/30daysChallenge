            <div class="answer">
                <p>To optimize website performance, you can use techniques like minimizing HTTP requests, compressing images, using browser caching, and minimizing JavaScript and CSS files. Additionally, consider using a content delivery network (CDN) to serve assets from servers located closer to the user, reducing latency and improving loading times.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface provided by web browsers that allows scripts (usually JavaScript) to dynamically access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a web page. It represents the page as a hierarchical tree of objects, making it possible to modify elements and their attributes in real-time.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Front-end development involves creating the user interface and user experience of a website or application. It focuses on designing and implementing the visual elements that users interact with directly. Back-end development, on the other hand, deals with server-side logic, databases, and other behind-the-scenes operations that power the application's functionality.</p>
